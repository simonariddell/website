This is a static website is built with [clojure](https://clojure.org/), using a few static helper libraries (primarily stasis, hiccup, and cegdown to render markdown). 

I chose to use this stack due to the crucial need to avoid stateful complexity an maintain functional purity for my tiny individually maintained static site... err... wait. No. I did it because it seemed fun, and I wanted to learn a little bit of clojure, functional programming, and the very basics of web-development without using a framework. 

To learn how to do this I relied on this great tutorial by Christian Johansen, Nick George, and burning a few tens of hours on 4clojure.com.
