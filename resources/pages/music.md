Hiroshi Yoshimura - Pier & Loft (1983) FULL ALBUM
I used to think that early Japanese anime and video game music was its own organic aesthetic, but
it seems it actually ties back to an earlier wave of Japanese music. I was surprised when I first heard it,
as I had thought that the vapor-wave aesthetic was a newer concept. 

Unlike the newer vapor-wave though, Hiroshi's music, while still minimalist, seems to have a 
more sincere connection. 

It's hard to listen to these albums, without imagining the nostalgia of early anime,
or wanting to walk through Tokyo in the Spring.

A few months after my brother finished chemotheraphy my wife and I went to see Kurt Vile live in Seattle.
It was my fourth time seeing him live. The first was in 2011, when he opened for Bright Eyes. The second in 2013 in London.
The third sometime around 2017, which I went to alone in Seattle following a minor surgery while on leave from San Francisco.
After months of oppressive sadness, this show was the first time I felt an energetic happiness.

I remember walking back on to the street with Alison, at sometime past midnight, and feeling blissful. 
This specific song has always been my favorite of Kurt Vile's, but this rendition was particularly great.

> I wanna walk out into the night
  Without it bein runnin away
  From a bad day in my brain

The music video for the song Road Head is worth watching. It has a 
ethereal, sci-fi, anime vibe. While still hiding a feeling of mundane
desperation.

Bright Eyes - Easy / Lucky / Free

Writing about this particular song is tough. Not because of any specific memory, but it represents a lot of
adolescent feelings. As we grow older, the complexity of emotions we have experience historically is compressed and forgotten.
We can look back on pain, and only feel a dull ache. The strangness of nostalgia sits in our memories. 

There was a point in my life where I was obsessed with nostalgia. It's sort of funny, since this was mainly when I was around 25.
I wasn't even that far out of my college years, but I couldn't stop myself from revisiting all these past feelings. The emotional rawness
of my early 20s was an open question. What was the point? I didn't think I could escape that sadness, and reveling in my past
for some reason felt like the solution. It become a personal aesthetic. Sadness, weed, and nostalgia were part of my identity.

Over time I realized there was no point. I remember asking a good friend for our old chat logs. She told me she deleted them, and I couldn't understand
why at the time. But the reason is that there is no point. It's over. It's better to spend time thinking of how we want to manipulate the future.

So, fine. Good. I won't dwell on the past. I'll code something instead. Creating things as an identity is healthier. 
 
But this song will always remind me of that emotionally raw kid I once was, which I can't ever fully escape.

Did it all get real? I guess it's real enough.
