Lots of interesting research and information is surfaced through a normal process,
where a smart person does a thing, and that thing is formally shared. This works well for
cases where the thing is very notable, very new, or the author is skilled at sharing.

However, often we forget about interesting old information (which even if it's not relevant, can help us understand
how people thought at the time), esoteric information, or cool weird things that the author doesn't share.
This set is dramatically underrated, and hard to find unless you have some practice in knowing where to look.

This is my list of links under that set:
