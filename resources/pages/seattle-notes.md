The emergence of social order in a protest.

- unclear leadership
- who put her in charge
- unclear enforcement
- lack of an endgame for protestors.

trembling hand equilibrium.
everyone is standing and waiting.
one mistake from anyone would result in disorder.
very unstable equilibrium

all the protestors in the front it's either unclear what they want
or they have different ideas of how it ends
a young mixed race women is trying to organize and shape the protest
it's unclear if people listen, one guy yells "Who put you in charge?"
"I'm so fucking sick of listening to you"

There is an emergence of different leaders.
She wants to maintain peace and avoid confrontation with the police.
You do get the impression many do want some sort of violent realization with the police,
but lack the courage to be the first to act. 

However, if one person made a mistake, and there was the fog of war, you can tell
they would be prepared to jump in. 

It sort of seemed like everyone got pushed from the front, but you couldn't really tell why.
did the police push them up? Did they just atke a step forward? Why was there a wave of people?
Other than a few people at the front, no one else would know either.

It seemed to temporarily inflame tensions.

It's important to note there is a mundaninty to this all. This pseudo-stand-off has been going on for
15 minutes.

This is a neighborhood that's on the edge of the city and a region with more townhouses, apartments, and houses.
It's not in the downtown region, but in capitol hill.

There continue to be debates and what look like power struggles with those at the front of the protest.
However, it's not even clear that the people in the back of the protest recognize a leaders.

Maybe a better way to think about it is the people in the back will follow whatever propogates down to them,
so the people at the front can decide to walk, fight, or something else custom, like give a speech.
If they walk, people behind will follow. If they fight, some people behind may join in.
If they give a speech or orchestrate some type of finale event, the people behind may find some level of
closure.


Now the people talking at the front seem to try and be whipping the rest of the people in earshot into a frenzy.
"They want to kill us. They want to ?? rape our girls"

My overall conclusion is that a protest without a leader, or an end, is unstable.
This gives the opportunity for subgroups to try and agitate towards their own ending.

If one smalls subgroup walks away though, why would another group walk away? They might, if they feel the density
is diminished. 

It's now been nearly 30 minutes or more of simply standing and faceing the police.


An office said they can march to Westlake.
There is widespread cheering. You can feel the tension dissipate, at least for now.

The streamer is an asshole. He keeps calling the women who is the de facto leader a cunt, loudly.
Some other women told him he's a sexist asshole, and they insulted each other for half a minute.
He said he's a gay man, and she said that doesn't mean he can't be sexist. 

Although the question of a satisfactory end that has everyone go home has just been postponed.

When the police remind them of the curfew, over a speaker, they yell 'fuck your curfew.'
It's a hard question as to whether they should enforce the curfew. They lose their credible threat,
but if there is a large peaceful protest of the high hundreds/low-thousands, it's hard to justify
shooting tear gas into the middle.

Young leader named David Lewis, who has been the de facto leader.
Watching him speak and lead is like watching the making of a leader.
He told the crowd to leave, and come back at 3pm the next day. Everyone is leaving now.

Most of the group has listened, and left. Some other groups don't agree, or seem to respect him.
But if those groups are too small, they won't have the cover to act out with impunity. 

If they do leave Seattle without violence, that seems to be an extremely strong predictor for deescalation.


First warning given, and the remaining seem to be the agitators.
The interesting part of this is by staggering warnings, and waiting, they can try to get
as many people out as possible, before needing to do any arrests.


June 1st:

June 1st ended up being more disruptive than the previous day. I watched a live-stream
of the protest for a few hours. It's exhausting actually. Without even being there in person, the emotional
exhaustion of watching everything happen can be overwhelming.

What strikes me the most is watching the perspective of an individual live-streamer, there is a level of information
asymmtery that is surprisingly intense. I say surprising because you'd of course think it's the case, but even
five feed beyond your immediate perspective is engulfed in the fog of war.

The protest was huge, and peaceful, up until it wasn't. The protestors were pushed up against a barricade,
which spanned a street. The police were standing behind the barricade. There were a few thousand protestors,
on the other side probably about two hundred police. The taxonomy of the protestors seems to roughly
fall into the following buckets:
1. There are the leader-types. There are three unoffiical leaders of the protest. I say unofficial because
while they are perhaps the official leaders of a subset of the group, there are protestors who joined
that don't recognize them as a leader. Even those who do recognize them as a leader, it's important to remember
there is no formal hierarchy. 
2. There are those who follow the leaders in 1. They either agree with their message of peaceful influence
or policy, or are malleable to those who presents themselves as a authorities. This is probably the correct group,
and who I would be if I were in the protest. In this case it's due to the fact that the leaders are black, or mixed,
and seem to be aspiring towards a message of reconciliation and policy change. It's obvious they feel the burden
of leadership. No one could accuse them of being out there having fun.
3. There are the normies. These are non-threatening supporters, who have no taste for any sort of disruption or violence.
Not much more to say about this group.
4. There is a sub-group of primarily angry black protestors. Their anger obviously is personal, and they aren't
interested in exploring a reconciliatory or policy end-game. They are instead angry, and can be found
near the front of the line screaming "Fuck the police" and similar phrases. This group, in Seattle, is pretty small.
Primarily due to the fact that there aren't many black people in Seattle, and this is just a subset of that group.
You could imagine this is a larger group in other cities. To be clear -- this group does not include looters.
5. There are bored high-school and college kids. Given a pandemic, staying at home, and unemployment, this group
of kids has nothing else to do. They might have come if times were normal, but they also might not have. I imagine
they are having a somewhat more intense version of the fun I had when I climbed public buildings in town to smoke
weed with my friends, or got into other mischief as a kid. You can see these kids youthful faces changing in the crowds.
They are willing to get into a little trouble, but there is also a naive harmlessness to them. The 19 year old blonde girl
on the front-line is inherently non-threatening.
6. There are black block antifa types. These are mostly white, mostly male. Although not strictly. When a crowd is trying
to be peaceful, they want to agitate and enact chaos. They do so cleverly. They'll throw something or light some fireworks off,
then slink off into the crowd, letting whoever is still standing there to take the punishment meant for them. They tend to carry a backpack full of tricks -- spraypaint, fireworks, crowbars, and so on.

In the Seattle protest, after contributing to the initial chaos, you could see them acting in orchestration to spill over dumpsters, make a barricade, and then stand on the dumpsters chanting and throwing things at the police. They clearly enjoy the chaos, and are having fun in some sense of the word.

7. Looters. None here tonight.

As an end-game tactic, the police seem to try to tire out the group. They keep pushing them to walk, and walk, and walk.
It's important to emphasis the mundanity of it all. Other than moments of punctuated intensity, the last two hours have just been walking. At some points the group gets fractured, or people get tired. Six hours of walking with little food obvoiusly
is exhausting.



The subgame nash equilibrium.

needless police agrression on tuesday.

The protestors got a meeting, but had no idea what they wanted.

watching twitch streams is fun, it look slike a video game.

Wednesday:
Omari went with the police. He went behind lines and spoke with Carmen Best, and gave a perspective
from the police.
The crowd overall seems more tempered, as though the anarchy has given way to a mission.
THis is partly seen in the opposition Mayor, who lost the election, taking some of the protestors with her
to bring demands to our current mayor.

Overall, depending on who I watch, or what my mood is, I can empathize with different groups.
The level of complexity of social dynamics, the information, is nearly impossible to comprehend.

At some moments I can feel, not hate, but disappointent and frustration with the police. When watching a live stream yesterday
I saw the police needlessly escalate. THere were agitators in the crowd, but the social dynamics of the crowd were otherwise
safe. I could tell because I was watching multiple streams for five hours.

On the other hand, the police didn't see that. if a few bottles were thrown, I would know they are not indiciative of the entire crowd.
Did the police know that? A few days ago molotovs were thrown at cop cars. 

If you look from the police perspective though, it would be difficult to be screamed at for five hours.
This can sometimes be intense. "Fuck you pussy" "Fuck the police" Nonstop. Over and over.

It's easy though for me to say that, as I didn't take a collatoral rubber bullet the other day.

Overall you can tell how much fun it must be. The comradership, the intensity, the tribalism, the subtle
threat of danger. 

However, I update my probability of covid spreading due to the intensity of chanting and oratory.

There is still a sense of religiosity in this whole event though, which I guess is probably
endemic to all protests or movements. The complexity of discussion isn't what drives tribal cooperation.
In tribal settings humans chant, dance, and perform for one another. We signal our shared bonds through
these signals. 

Still, despite my distate with that, this has reminded me of a lot of my own frustrations with the police.
These frustrations that dissipated as I grew older, but were at their peak when I was in college.
Funny how that works.

At an object level, the racism of the police as identified by police shooting black people or committing
violence to black people doesn't convince me. The data isn't that unequivocal on this topic. I'm also
very disturbed by topics where discussing the data is considered politically off limits. We could also say
even if this is true, does it justify the focus to the exclusion of all else? Is the benefit from this
greater than other policy topics, that it should be all we focus on?

Still, there is a second order effect we risk missing with this empericism. There is a certain 'danger region'
of the tail, which I believe is both the hardest to measure, but also explains the most. Unfortunately, the information
embedded in this region of the tail only seems to exist within personal stories, shared experiences, and written stories.

-books-

If blacks in America do feel this is true, it's perhaps worth taking seriously.

But what if there is another take entirely? Which is that the data is true, and the hidden part of the tail isn't fat,
is this still justified? I think it could be. But it requires understanding we truly are tribal and racial animals.


To this extent I can support the reform of the police, but my greatest fear is we will forget the importance of policing systems and enforcing social order.

Over time we have overloaded the police system with too many responsibilities and laws to uphold, with the culminating factor of the breaking of all laws is violence.

But violence is still crucial. A good social order needs to run off violence. There is always a portion of society willing to commit chaos or kill at a moments notice, and they need to be promptly and efficiently removed from society. 

The police eventually left the eastern precinct 10 days later on a Monday. They are lined up on streets around the city. Within the city the 'protesters' are just standing around the precinct, not really sure what to do. A fatter black guy took the microphone, and has been yelling into it for an hour or two, a mixture of platitudes and inanity.

Yet they don't really seem to know what to do now. There are no real speakers, no leaders, no marches. The main event, the fun line they could line up to face the police, is now gone.

In a strange way, this is a microcosm of what happens when an anatonizing force takes over 

Random people keep coming up and taking the microphone, given poorly inspired speeches, and trying to captivate the crowd. 

"Do we have more demands"
"YES"
"Do we have more demands"
"YES"
"What's our message, say message"
"MESSAGE"
"If you have demands to add, step up to the microphone"

Overall, it's a mess. There is no direction, no structure, and no mechanism for determining what comes next. While the atagonism of the police was unwelcome, the end of the night was determiend. Each night had an exciting climax. What is happening now? This group of people has selected for those who want excitement and adrenaline. Who else would come over and over to stand and yell on a police line?

One by one people come stand up and make platitude laden speeches. As each person comes to take a microphone, the wannabe leaders keep bickering. Now they're saying the real leaders don't count, as they aren't there.

Someone new is "demanding more funding for all medical departments. We're going to take money from the police put it in the medical department." 

It's a bizarro victory-speech of revolutionary LARPers. 

"I'm an environmental scientist, we cannot have another Katrina or Flint. We need our government to address environmental racism." Followed by an unusually large cheer.

This same fat black man hogging the microphone shows the power of a bad speech giver in draining the energy. He isn't uniquely bad, but continues to repeat himself with no end goal. Again, after hours, hefinds himself saying again "We want real change."

Each member takes a brief moment with the mic to state their demands.

Most are banal, but this one women said we need to build a decentralized election system using high quality technology professionals, which was an interesting and cool change of pace.


Kshama Sawant is giving a speech on the merits of socialism and against capitalism now. There is of course the immediate reaction which is that these systems actually work, and human systems that work are difficult to establish.

But is this rational for the protestors? By that I mean, we can try to be smug about it, and think to ourselves "Well, these people surely won't win, but if they do, they'll sure regret it." But will they? This seems fun. I mean, not for me, but for them, right? What else would they be doing tonight? Studying?

Of course, the importance of a functioning society is to try to get these people to study instead of doing this revolutionary LARPing. So to that end it's a failure if people would have more fun playing revolutionary. What can you do though? 

As Sawant was speaking a young black man with dreads came and said, interupting here, "People shooting each other downtown, and shooting up heroin, this has to stop." 

There is a mundanity though for the talk of a youth rebellion from Sawant to then end with her discussing how she got $15 as a minimum wage. It doesn't sound so glamerous when discussing a revolution.


Are you for abolishing the police.
"I will give you an answer"
There is silence, but interuptions.

The fat black man is speeking again "We don't care if you get rid of Jenny Durkan, we don't give a fuck, someone will replace her, we want to destroy the whole system."

It's not clear if the group has any consistent view. They were all pushed together by their enjoyment of antagonizing the police and being against the system, but what their intersection of preferences is is unclear.

This man is talking for minutes, ends with "Whose side are you on?"

It's clear this group has no leaders or intellectual capital.

"You're at war with us, you came down here, and say 50% police, you're going against our first demand which is defunding."

The fat black man mocked her accent, saying 'sorry' in an indian accent. He's been immediately cancelled.
the crowd is booing him, and taking the microphone away. 

He seems like he may be high on amphetamines, to be honest. 

The rapper took the microphone away, and is walking away from Sawant now. Now Raz is talking about how we need to use this as an opportunity to 'educate this brother.'

The crowd ultimately doesn't seem to care about Sawant.

After screaming he's not racist on the microphone, and the energy of the crowd souring, someone new took the microphone and started getting the crowd to chant "George Floyd."

While I typically don't like to think of members of a crowd, or individuals, as stupid, since it's a lazy proxy for actually understanding them, I have to admit, it's tempting right now.
