It's interesting how the perception of shortages is scarier than there being items in the market that you
simply can't afford, but are present and available. Earlier today there was a discussion of meat shortages
due to corona-virus. The idea of meat not being in the store is scarier than not being able to afford it.
Yet in most cases the result of whether food is available or not is related to the pricing mechanism.
If stores can raise their prices, they'll remain fully stocked. If they can't, meat will sell-out.
The latter results in empty shelves, which is scary. 

During the time of the Soviet Union the fullness of our grocery stores represented our abundance.
And while we certainly did have more than the Soviet Union, the fullness of our grocery store was due
to a functioning pricing mechanism. 

In that sense I find the pricing mechanism comforting. It means there will always be supplies available,
so if someone *really* needs them, they can get them instantly.

You definitely do not want to agree with every thinker you follow. But they shouldn't be completely
unhinged either, or pundits.
